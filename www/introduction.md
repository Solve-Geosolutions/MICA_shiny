## Introduction
The following is a help document to explain the usage of the MICA (Mineral Identification and Compositional Analysis) program designed by [Solve Geosolutions](www.solvegeosolutions.com)

It is currently freely availible [here](https://solvegeosolutions.shinyapps.io/MICA/).

The initial blog post when we released it can be found [at our website](http://solvegeosolutions.com/2018/08/mica-mineral-identification-and-compositional-analysis/)

Please try out MICA and let us know if you have any success with it - also feel free to let us know if you have any problems with it, or if you've got any suggested improvements, contact us at [information@solvegeosolutions.com](information@solvegeosolutions.com)
